# Feature-specific lessons

Moved out of CLAUDE.md to keep it under its size limit. Same rules: problem, then fix; verified only.

- `RenderSystem.setShaderColor` does not exist in 26.1.2, so there is no global colour multiplier and items
  cannot be tinted per-item. The inventory HUD's Opacity now dims items with a translucent quad drawn over the
  panel after the item loop instead: 0 hides the panel outright, and the darkening is capped at 80% so no
  setting turns it into an unreadable black box.
- The gametest client runs as **java.exe**, not javaw.exe. `run-scenario.ps1` filtered on javaw only, so every
  safeguard in it was inert — the freeze watcher never saw an unresponsive client and the deadline cleanup
  killed nothing, while the script reported success. That is why "it still doesn't close out on freeze"
  survived two rounds of fixes to the watching logic.
- **A `HudElement`'s `render()` is not always where it draws.** For `croesus_start_button`,
  `experiments_start_button`, `rng_meter_ranking`, `storage_overlay`, `inventory_hud` and `custom_scoreboard`,
  `render()` is ONLY the HUD editor's preview and the real pixels come from a container-screen or Fabric HUD
  layer elsewhere in the feature; `etherwarp_waypoints` never draws at all (`isVisible()` is hardcoded false).
  So anything that needs to know "was this on screen" must be placed at each feature's own draw site, not on
  the interface method. That is what `hud/HudSeen` does, and why `isRelevantNow` was split into
  `isEnabledInSettings()` (the toggle) plus the draw stamp on 2026-09-30 - the old single predicate had
  already drifted from the render path it mirrored in four places (Split Timers' tested `isInDungeon()` and
  its `render` did not).
- `Map.getOrDefault` EVALUATES its default eagerly. `HudConfig.getPosition` allocated a throwaway `int[2]` on
  every call even when a saved value existed - about 110 allocations a frame across the HUD.
- Instant Transmission is 8 blocks on Aspect of the End, Aspect of the Void AND the Etherwarp Conduit alike.
  What changes the range is the item's own `tuned_transmission` tag - a Transmission Tuner adds a block, four
  maximum - so a fully tuned one of any of them goes 12, and killer560 plays fully tuned ("nearly no one plays
  with less"). AOTV is NOT 12 by nature; assuming that got AOTE and AOTV wrongly split in the route matcher
  once already. `EtherwarpHopper` reads the same tag for the 57-block etherwarp.
- `ItemIdentity.of()` is shared by Auto Sell, the Inventory Sorter, Armour Dye and the mining profit tracker.
  Widening it to make two items equal makes "sell my Hyperion" sell an Astraea. Loose matching belongs in
  `matches()`, which only a route's USE_ITEM node reaches.
- **A HUD element's `width()` must be in the registry's unit, and the HUD editor saves on a zero-pixel
  click.** `HudElementRegistry` defines an element's on-screen size as `width() * HudConfig` scale, but the
  Storage Overlay's `defaultX()` centred against `width() * its own slider scale` and its render pose used a
  third combination, so the clamp, the editor box and the drawn panel measured three different panels
  (2026-09-30). A clamp also cannot rescue a panel *wider* than the screen - it only picks which columns to
  hide - so `gridWidthLocal()` now drops columns until the grid fits. Separately, `HudEditorScreen.
  mouseReleased` persists a position for any press-release on a box, drag or not: one click in the editor
  while the window was briefly 854x480 froze `storage_overlay` at the clamped `x:0` and it stayed there at
  2560x1441, which is what "the storage overlay is no longer centered" turned out to be. A saved position is
  never re-clamped, so the cure is deleting the element's entry from `killer560smod-hud.json`.
- **Superpairs powerups come in two kinds, told apart by lore.** "Instant powerup!" (the `+479,095 XP` lapis
  block, "Gained +3 Clicks") applies on the spot; only "Powerup for next click!" (Instant Find) matches the next
  click. Arming on both spent a lone click on an Enchanted Book and reserved it, blocking its pair (2026-10-01).
  XP reward tiles are recognised by NAME (`... Enchanting Exp`): the item varies, and cocoa beans were missed.
  Clicking a tile that is already uncovered does not use a click (killer560, 2026-10-01). A pair's first click
  can fail to land (tile still covered, others still read "Click any button!"); clicking the partner anyway lost
  Experiment the Fish, so the first tile is now re-clicked before its partner.
- `ServerTickClock`'s subscribers cannot measure a lag spike: a real stall drops the ping rate under 15/s,
  the clock flips to client-tick fallback, and what it fires is the client's own ticks. Anything measuring
  server stalls subscribes to `subscribeRawPing` instead (as `experiments/ServerLagSensor` does).
- **Hypixel's Bazaar summaries are named the opposite of how they read.** In
  `api.hypixel.net/v2/skyblock/bazaar`, `buy_summary` is the book you INSTANT-BUY OUT OF and `sell_summary` is
  the one you instant-sell into. Verified on `VIBRANT_CORAL` (2026-09-29): `quick_status.buyPrice` 3324220.9
  matches `buy_summary[0].pricePerUnit` and `sellPrice` 221605.8 matches `sell_summary[0]`. Reading them the
  other way round produced a fake 1.6-billion-coin flip. `quick_status.buyPrice` is also a weighted AVERAGE,
  matching the exact top of book on only 628 of 1833 products, so anything sizing a real purchase must walk the
  levels. Scale check for the Bazaar-to-NPC flipper: of 819 products with an `npc_sell_price` only ~46 profit at
  all and the worthwhile margins are 0.4%-1.5% - a result far outside that band means the book is backwards.
- A hotbar swap sent as `setSelectedSlot` + a hand-made `ServerboundSetCarriedItemPacket` goes out TWICE:
  `MultiPlayerGameMode.tick()` calls `ensureHasSentCarriedItem()`, which compares against its own `carriedIndex`
  (never updated by the hand-made packet) and sends the same slot again (javap, 26.1.2 and 26.2). Swap through
  `MultiPlayerGameModeInvoker.killer560smod$invokeEnsureHasSentCarriedItem()` instead, as `RouteExecutor.select`
  does since 2026-10-04. AutoI4, Breaker Aura, ClearExecutor, AP3, Secret Triggerbot, MaskSwapper and Auto Debuff
  still use the hand-made form.
- Packet order inside one client tick (javap, 26.1.2): `START_CLIENT_TICK`, `gameMode.tick()`, `handleKeybinds`
  (vanilla clicks), the player tick (`ServerboundPlayerInputPacket` if the input changed, then `sendPosition`),
  `ServerboundClientTickEndPacket`, then `END_CLIENT_TICK`. The server applies the input packet's shift on arrival
  and `handleUseItem` snaps to the use packet's own yaw/pitch before using, so a sneak installed by the input mixin
  is in force for a use sent at the next START - no round trip to wait for.
- The mod's own widget labels are not drawn through `GuiGraphicsExtractor.text`; they go through
  `GuiGraphicsExtractor$RenderingTextCollector.accept`. A text hook that only targets `text` misses every
  button and label in the settings GUI (found when keeping Name Changer out of the mod's own menus, 2026-10-04).
- Chained Auto Routes etherwarps each logged "acted 1 tick(s) ... sneak went out in the firing tick's input packet"
  (his maplogger-latest2.log, 2026-10-04) because the executor kept sneak only for a next etherwarp in the SAME
  stack; the interact-delay settle ticks after a landing then sent shift up and the next warp re-sneaked. Held
  sneak is now decided after every node by `RouteExecutor.planSneak` from the node that actually fires next.
