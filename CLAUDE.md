# killer560s-mod

A Fabric client mod for Hypixel Skyblock, mostly Catacombs dungeons: solvers, HUDs, timers, a dungeon map,
and (in one of the two build variants) automation. Personal toolkit that friends also use.

## Build and run

Java 25 and a JDK on `JAVA_HOME`. Gradle wrapper, Fabric Loom.

```
./gradlew build                     # legit variant  -> build/libs/killer560smod-1.1.0-legit.jar
./gradlew build -PcheatBuild=true   # cheat variant  -> build/libs/killer560smod-1.1.0-cheat.jar
./gradlew build -Prelease=true      # official release: compiles dev tooling OUT
```

Both variants come from the same source. `build.gradle` generates
`com.killer560.hub.BuildVariant.CHEAT_FEATURES_ENABLED` from `-PcheatBuild`, and `DEV_TOOLS` from
`-Prelease`. Because they are `static final boolean`, javac folds every `CHEAT_FEATURES_ENABLED && x` down
to `false` in a legit build and deletes the branch, which is the point.

Versions, all from `gradle.properties` (check there, not here, if something looks off): Minecraft 26.1.2,
Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.155.2+26.1.2, Loom 1.17-SNAPSHOT, Mod Menu 18.0.0, mod version 1.1.0,
Netty 4.2.7.Final (bundled Jar-in-Jar for the Proxy Client feature; must match what MC 26.1.2 ships).
`fabric.mod.json` declares `minecraft ~26.1`, `java >=25`, entrypoints `client` and `modmenu`.

## Testing

Boot-test only in the Prism instance **26.1.2 (Mod Only Test)**, and close the game afterwards. The
instance **26.1.2 (Dungeons)** is him actually playing — never install a test jar there, never boot it, and
never draw a conclusion from its log.

Never swap a jar over a running game; stage it as `.jar.pending`. Never blanket `taskkill javaw` — kill
only the PID that was launched, and if the log shows a server join, he took the window, so leave it.

There is an anticheat harness at `C:\Users\Hunter\killer560s-mod-testkit` that runs features against a real
GrimAC on a real dedicated server. See its own `CLAUDE.md`.

## Layout

Source under `src/main/java/com/killer560/hub/`, one package per feature area (`ap3`, `dungeonextras`,
`secrets`, `livemap`, `autopuzzles`, `terminals`, `leveraura`, `gui/tab`, `util`, …). Mixins live in a
`mixin` subpackage of the feature that owns them. Docs: `docs/FEATURES.md` holds the full text for every
feature; `README.md` holds the name list.

Shared pieces worth knowing: `util/ActionGate` is the mod-wide one-automated-interaction-per-tick arbiter
with actor priority; `util/SkyblockGate` is the "Skyblock Only" gate; `secrets/DungeonState` owns floor and
boss-phase detection; `util/ViewFreeze` holds the camera still while something rotates the real player.

## Conventions

Every setting must survive a restart: add the field, load it, save it, and expose a getter and setter.
A new feature gets its name in the README list and its full text in `docs/FEATURES.md`, then the features
Google Doc is regenerated. Sharing and receiving settings default ON. The GUI is orange-themed. Never carry
his typos into a command, label or alias.

Never track a `HANDOFF.md` in the repo; handoff notes live only in
`C:\Users\Hunter\.claude\killer560s-mod-HANDOFF-PRIVATE.txt`. The Discord bot token lives at
`C:\Users\Hunter\.claude\secrets\killer560smod-discord-bot-token.txt` and is never printed or committed.
The features Google Doc **edit** link is never published; only the `/e/2PACX-…` published link is public.

## Safety rules for automation

These are his, they are about getting banned, and they are not negotiable. Never write position or velocity
directly (`setPos`, `setDeltaMovement`) and never use fractional movement input — discrete key presses only,
and abort on any server correction. Never clamp or wrap simulated yaw at 0-360; Hypixel treats an uncapped
running rotation value as the normal signal. Pitch is always kept within -90..+90. Anticheat *deception*
features (blink, inventory walk) were declined in September 2026 and stay declined.

## Quirks and lessons

- Mixin config uses `defaultRequire: 0`, so a wrong target signature fails **silently** and the feature
  just never runs. Verify targets with `javap` against the mapped jar in `.gradle/loom-cache/` before
  trusting a new mixin. A probe that silently counts nothing reports zeroes that read as findings.
- A class placed inside a mixin-owned package throws `IllegalClassLoadError` and crashes the game at boot.
  Keep helper classes out of `mixin` packages.
- Interaction features must tick on `ClientTickEvents.START_CLIENT_TICK`, not `END_CLIENT_TICK`: END runs
  after the player's own movement packet, and GrimAC flags every resulting interaction as `Post`. Measured
  2026-09-27 — Breaker Aura drew 808 violations on END and zero on START; Secret Triggerbot 17 and 17.
  Fixed for Breaker Aura in `825f319`. **About twenty other features still tick on END.**
- `RenderSystem.setShaderColor` does not exist in 26.1.2. Item rendering moved to another path, so the
  inventory HUD's opacity setting cannot affect items.
- Forwarding a self-registered client command name to the server recurses through Fabric's command API and
  StackOverflows. Send below the dispatcher via `util/ServerCommands.toServer`.
- `DungeonState.toggleSimOverride()` (the `/killer560 sim` command) forces floor, F7 **and boss phase** on
  together, so it shuts the gate on any feature that requires *not* being in the boss. To get a dungeon that
  is not a boss, let floor detection run for real off a scoreboard sidebar line reading
  "The Catacombs (F7)".
- Several features gate on `getCurrentServer().ip` containing `hypixel.net` or `p3sim.net`, with no
  override anywhere in the codebase.
- Reach must be measured to the block's **box**, not its centre — the centre reads up to half a block
  further and makes a module look out of range when it is not.
- `setBreakerAuraCooldownTicks` clamped to a minimum of 1 while the field defaults to 0, so the default
  could never be restored once the setter ran. Fixed 2026-09-27. Worth checking other setters for the same
  mismatch between setter clamp and field default.
